Speech Recognition Calculator (Speaker Dependent)
Software used : MATLAB

This is the code for speaker dependent speech recognition calculator.
Speaker-dependent software works by learning the
unique characteristics of a single person’s voice, in a
way similar to voice recognition. New users must first
“train” the software by speaking to it, so the computer
can analyze how the person talks. This often means
users have to read a few pages of text to the computer
before they can use the speech recognition software.

Advantages:
i. People with disabilities.
ii. Organizations - Increases productivity, reduces costs and
errors.
iii. Lower operational Costs.
iv. Advances in technology will allow consumers and
businesses to implement speech recognition systems at a
relatively low cost.

Disadvantages :
i. Difficult to build a perfect system.
ii. Filtering background noise is a task that can even be
difficult for humans to accomplish.
iii. Every human being has differences such as their
voice, mouth, and speaking style.

Steps to follow :
1. Run calibrate_voice_numbers to record your voice for each number.
2. Run speech_recog_calc to speak first number and second number and then select the option to Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide them.
